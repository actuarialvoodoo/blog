# Spreadsheets

## One File/Many Responsibilties

## Analysis Documentation(?)

???

Spreadsheets are Everywhere

A lot of these problems stem from using a spreadsheet program to build
an analysis application.

* Single File Problems
  - Can't be edited/fully accessed by multiple people simultaneously
  - Do many things (database, multiple algos, visulization)
  
* Reproducibilty Problems

Repeating (or Updating) an analysis can be challenging because the steps of
analysis might be encodeded several different ways (even in the same analysis) 
and may involve manual steps.
  - spreadsheet formula
  - macro 
  - notes in a spreadsheet, or across multiple spreadsheets
  - separately maintained documentation
  - inside the analyst's head

* Maintainence, Update, and Validation Problems

  - no ability to track changes
  - VBA Code editor is feature deficient
  - Difficult to find errors and changes in spreadsheet formula as well as VBA logic
  - brittle to changes

## Is there a better way?

## Let's use tools and patterns from Reproducible Data Science.

### What do we want?

* Ability to multiple people to maintain/edit/update simultaneously

* separation of concerns

* reproducible

* elastic to changes

* source control

* consistent starting place (like the template)

# An Idea

## R package with common function and analysis templates

## R markdown

## git

## drake

## renv

???
# Advantages

## Reproducible

## Easy to Extend

## Easy to Collaborate
