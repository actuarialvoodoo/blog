## TLDR

I created a new backup plan making use of a Raspberry Pi NAS; fun was had.

## Motivation

```{r prior_state, echo=FALSE}

library(DiagrammeR)

nodes <- create_node_df(
  n = 3,
  type =  "a",
  label = c("My computer", "External HD", "Cloud Storage"),
  shape = "rectangle",
  width = c(1, 1, 1),
  x = c(2, 1, 3),
  y = c(2, 1, 1)
)
edges <- create_edge_df(
  from = c(1, 1),
  to = c(2, 3),
  rel = "leading_to",
  style = "dashed"
)

graph <- create_graph(
  nodes_df = nodes,
  edges_df = edges
)

render_graph(graph)
```


I had been hitting some snags with my backup plan for a while.
